For testing accept and connect, one way that was implemented was inside the selfTest() function of NetKernel, making a NetProcess instance
to be able to call the handleAccept() and handleConnect() functions through the handleSyscall() function within every NetProcess. 
The sample test that was implemented involved connecting a host(0), port(0) with host(1), port(0). To have one machine instance call
the handleConnect() function and the other call the handleAccept() function, an if statement was also put within the selfTest() function 
of the NetKernel to check what machine instance you were put in. The sample test had it set up so that host(1) would be calling 
handleConnect() to the host(0), port(0) and host(0) would be calling handleAccept() on port(0). To make sure that the messages weren't 
sent before the, hosts/machine instances, were activated the implementation of the code waiting for input to follow through was left as
is. So as to make sure ordering was successful, pressing enter on host(1) (pressing enter in the console), because it's calling connect, 
will send syn message to host(0) so when you press enter on host(0)'s console it should call accept and notice that there's a pending
connection on that port. To start multiple machine instances on intellij, just simply press the run machine button as many times as
you want machine instances.
